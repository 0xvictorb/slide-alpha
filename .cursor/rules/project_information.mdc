I want to build the following application, here is the detail:
- Tiktok-like platform, scroll to watch
- Creator can upload their content (video, images) into the platform (web2 for now, integrate with convex)
- When creating content, user can select to link to any tokens on the SUI blockchain that user think they're promoting that token, and from that, creator can receive commission fee if user doing buy/sell via their video
- Their will be premium content while creating also, and creator can select that, but only when they have more than 100 followers (for example)
- User can watch video freely
- For account, they'll interact via connect SUI wallet
- For premium content, they will need to pay to watch, amount can be set by creator
- On each free video, user can like/dislike to determine whether content is helpful or not. That'll affect their ranking on recommendation system.
- Some normal features like: profile, follow, comment.
- When a video attached with a token, we'll display it, show the token price, token chart, trading histories,... and buy/sell.
- User watch video to get insight and also maybe gas-sponsor via platform (can be later, just perform swap enough)
